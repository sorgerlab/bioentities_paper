,,Rb,UP,P06400,HGNC,9884,,,17825503,"When cells are stimulated to enter S phase, Rb family is phosphorylated by the cyclin and cyclin dependent kinase system and E2F is released from the E2F/Rb complex."
,,FimH,UP,P08191,,,,,17630833,We have found that inhibition of Src family kinases using either the PP1 or PP2 inhibitor significantly interferes with FimH mediated invasion of host bladder cells by UPEC.
,,IL-6,UP,P05231,HGNC,6018,,,22351606,"On the other hand, autocrine IL-6 signalling has been reported to promote tumour cell growth in lung and breast cancer cells (Gao et al, XREF_BIBR; Sansone et al, XREF_BIBR)."

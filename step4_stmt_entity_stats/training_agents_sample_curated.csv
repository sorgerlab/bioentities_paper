,,TOX3,UP,O15405,HGNC,11972,,,21172805,"TOX3 also interacts with native CREB and induces the CREB responsive BCL-2 promoter, which can be inhibited by coexpression of CITED1."
,,ChIP,UP,Q9UNE7,HGNC,11427,,,26645581,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with an ATF2 antibody in melanoma cells with high abundance of phosphorylated ATF2 (501Mel and LU1205 cells) revealed that ATF2 does bind the FUK promoter at E1, whereas it was not detected at the E2- or E3 proximal regions (XREF_FIG), suggesting that the E1 binding site is required for ATF2 mediated transcriptional repression."

,,Sec16,UP,O15027,HGNC,29006,,,22595671,"For example, in an RNAi screen, Farhan and colleagues found that ERK1/2 phosphorylates Sec16, and this phosphorylation event modulates the number of ER exit sites and ER-to-Golgi transport (XREF_BIBR)."
,,invasion,MESH,D009361,,,,,25826088,These results were consistent with a previous study indicating that Bcl-2 promoted tumor invasion and lung metastasis via increased MMP2 expression [XREF_BIBR].
,,Gata4,UP,P43694,HGNC,4173,,,20833366,"Our results demonstrating that a Gata4 mutant in which lysine residues are mutated to mimic constitutive acetylation can not be inhibited by Hdac2 allow us to conclude that direct deacetylation of Gata4, rather than deacetylation of histones, is responsible for Hdac2 mediated repression of Gata4 in this system."
,,PKC isoforms,,,,,,,25659151,"Furthermore, GSK-3beta is selectively phosphorylated by PKC isoforms, resulting in its inactivation and corresponding upregulation of GSK-3beta inhibited pathways [XREF_BIBR]."
,,Nedd4,UP,P46934,HGNC,7727,,,17116753,"Moreover, this interaction requires the presence of active Nedd4, because overexpression of a catalytically inactive Nedd4 (CS) precludes the association of GGA3 with the Nedd4 and LAPTM5 complex."

,,NS,UP,Q9BVP2,HGNC,29931,,,20849854,"Moreover, NS [XREF_BIBR] and C23 [XREF_BIBR] also associate with this region of MDM2 and inhibit MDM2 E3 ligase activity on both itself and p53."
,,integrin,UP,P08648,HGNC,6141,,,10773191,"Notably, activation of beta integrins by a beta specific antibody results in upregulation of beta integrin induced cell adhesion not only to the intact FN molecule, but also to alphabeta, alphabeta and PG binding FN fragments (the latter three located within the 33/66-kD FN fragment) by a mechanism sensitive to treatments with receptor specific antibodies (i.e. to alpha, alpha, beta and CD44) and chondrotinase, thus revealing a cooperation between beta integrins and CSPGs."
,,TRAIL,UP,P50591,HGNC,11925,,,19349211,"Consistent with other reports [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR], our data demonstrate that normal human PTEC are not sensitive to TRAIL induced apoptosis, suggesting that TRAIL and TRAIL-R interaction, unlike Fas-FasL interaction on PTEC, is not involved in the development of tubular atrophy in lupus GN."

,,FcgammaRIIa,UP,P12318,HGNC,3616,,,21856937,"FcgammaRIIa bound its Fc ligand in an asymmetric fashion between the two CH2 domains and the lower hinge regions (XREF_FIG), which is similar to FcgammaRIII (CD16) (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR), and consistent with mutagenesis of Fc and functional studies of IgG (XREF_BIBR)."

,,hydrolase,PF,PF00702,,,,,18206973,"As suspected from its domain structure, USP22 is able to hydrolyze a ubiquitin linkage from histone H2B in vitro and endogenous USP22 contributes ubiquitin hydrolase activity to the hSAGA complex."

,,cell death,GO,GO:0008219,,,,,12045249,"GM-CSF prevented MDCs from dying, while IL-3 or CpG-ODNs (phosphorothioate form [2006] and phosphodiester form [AAC30]) efficiently blocked the cell death of PDCs, a result that was consistent with the previous studies (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR)."

,,TLN,UP,Q9UMF0,HGNC,5348,,,11719200,"Thus, both the C-terminal tail and the first transmembrane domain (Val-82-Ser-102) and possibly part of the first luminal loop domain of PS1 constitute binding sites for TLN.Interestingly, radiolabeled APP and C99 was recovered on exactly the same recombinant GST-PS1 fragments as TLN, corroborating our conclusion that APP and TLN bind to very similar sites in PS1.Using four independent in vitro and in vivo approaches, compelling evidence was obtained that TLN binds to PS1 and PS2."

,,Cbl,UP,P22681,HGNC,1541,,,11494134,"The major proline rich region of Cbl was required for its phosphorylation by c-Abl, but not by a constitutively activated Abl mutant, suggesting Cbl activates c-Abl by engaging its SH3 domain."
,,BCL6,UP,P41182,HGNC,1001,,,12860928,"To examine whether BCL6 binds the CD80 enhancer in vivo, we performed ChIP assays in Ntera-2 cells cotransfected with vectors expressing c-Rel, p50, BCL6, a control reporter lacking CD80 sequences (TK-CAT) and a reporter gene containing either the wild-type (CD80-TK-CAT) or the M7 mutant (CD80 [M7]-TK-CAT) of the CD80 enhancer."
